This Moodle plugin adds a new predictive model to identify students that are likely to miss assignment due dates and it automatically 

This prediction model does not work for the following assignment activities:
- Assignments in courses without a start date
- Assignments without a due date
- Assignments that are hidden to students
- Not yet started assignments
- Team submission assignments
- Assignments whose due dates are more than one year after the course start date

The plugin uses Moodle core's analytics API as a base. This predictive model indicators become available for the other predictive models in your site as well as for the predictive models you add in future
